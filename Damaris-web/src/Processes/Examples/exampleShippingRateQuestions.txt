QUESTION TO ASK


Start the process
What’s on the shipping agenda for today?


Dimension of the object?
Next stop: dimensions! What’s the size in length, width and height of the item we’re sending?
Could you kindly spill the beans on the size—length, width, and height?


For the weight
Great! And what’s the weight of the item? Is it in pounds or ounces?


Asking for the full Destination  address
Let’s move on to the destination address. Could you provide the complete street address where you want to ship your item?

Destination Address
May I have the street where you’d like the package delivered

Zip
Could you share the zip code or postal code for the destination?

City
Could you share the city where the package will be sent?

State
My memory is failing me—what was the state you want to sent the address again?

Service Speed
When would you like this package to reach its destination?
What’s the delivery timeline you have in mind?

1. Finally, for communication purposes, could you share your email address and phone number?
